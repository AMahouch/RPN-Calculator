# RPN Calculator in Python

Reverse Polish Notation is where the ***operators follow the operands***, also known as a Postfix notation. For example, ```2 3 * 4 5 + * 6 +``` computes to ```60```.

In this code, the Python script opens the file ```RPN_Input.txt``` and computes the result of each line in RPN.

### Run
```python RPN_Calc.py```
